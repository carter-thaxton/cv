### OpenCV for Node.js

This module wraps the [OpenCV 1.x API](http://docs.opencv.org/modules/core/doc/old_basic_structures.html) for Node.js, using [node-ffi](http://github.com/rbranson/node-ffi) and [ref](http://github.com/TooTallNate/ref).

It provides a nice, Javascript friendly API over OpenCV, without actually using any native C/C++ whatsoever.
